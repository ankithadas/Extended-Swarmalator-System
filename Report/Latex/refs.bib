  abstract  = {There is growing evidence in favor of the temporal-coding hypothesis that temporal correlation of neuronal discharges may serve to bind distributed neuronal activity into unique representations and, in particular, that theta (3.5-7.5 Hz) and delta (0.5 < 3.5 Hz) oscillations facilitate information coding. The theta- and delta-rhythms are shown to be involved in various sleep stages, and during anesthesia, they undergo changes with the depth of anesthesia. We introduce a thalamocortical model of interacting neuronal ensembles to describe phase relationships between theta- and delta-oscillations, especially during deep and light anesthesia. Asymmetric and long-range interactions among the thalamocortical neuronal oscillators are taken into account. The model results are compared with experimental observations. The delta- and theta-activities are found to be separately generated and are governed by the thalamus and cortex, respectively. Changes in the degree of intraensemble and interensemble synchrony imply that the neuronal ensembles inhibit information coding during deep anesthesia and facilitate it during light anesthesia.},

  abstract = {Synchronization occurs in many natural and technological systems, from cardiac pacemaker cells to coupled lasers. In the synchronized state, the individual cells or lasers coordinate the timing of their oscillations, but they do not move through space. A complementary form of self-organization occurs among swarming insects, flocking birds, or schooling fish; now the individuals move through space, but without conspicuously altering their internal states. Here we explore systems in which both synchronization and swarming occur together. Specifically, we consider oscillators whose phase dynamics and spatial dynamics are coupled. We call them swarmalators, to highlight their dual character. A case study of a generalized Kuramoto model predicts five collective states as possible long-term modes of organization. These states may be observable in groups of sperm, Japanese tree frogs, colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles, and other biological and physical systems in which self-assembly and synchronization interact.},

The model consists of a population of identical integrate-and-fire oscillators. The coupling between oscillators is pulsatile: when a given oscillator fires, it pulls the others up by a fixed amount, or brings them to the firing threshold, whichever is less.The main result is that for almost all initial conditions, the population evolves to a state in which all the oscillators are firing synchronously. The relationship between the model and real communities of biological oscillators is discussed; examples include populations of synchronously flashing fireflies, crickets that chirp in unison, electrically synchronous pacemaker cells, and groups of women whose menstrual cycles become mutually synchronized.}},

  abstract = {This paper theoretically and qualitatively describes the calling behavior of the Japanese tree frog Hyla japonica with a simple model of phase oscillators. Experimental analysis showed that while an isolated single male frog called nearly periodically, two interacting male frogs called periodically but alternately, with little overlap. We model these phenomena as a system of coupled phase oscillators, where each isolated oscillator behaves periodically as a model of the calling of a single frog, and two coupled oscillators show antiphase synchronization, reflecting the alternately calling behavior of two interacting frogs. Then, we extend the model to a system of three coupled oscillators virtually corresponding to three interacting male frogs, and analyse the nonlinear dynamics and the bifurcation. We also discuss the biological meaning of the calling behavior and its possible application to artificial life and robotics.},

The mapping can be made quantitative, and under some necessary approximations a class of Kuramoto-like models, those with bimodal distribution of the frequencies, is most appropriate for the power-grid. In fact in the power-grid there are two kinds of oscillators: the “sources" delivering power to the “consumers".},

  abstract      = {We show that series arrays of N identical overdamped Josephson junctions have extremely degenerate dynamics. In particular, we prove that such arrays have N − 3 constants of motion for all N ⩾ 3. The analysis is based on a coordinate transformation that reduces the governing equations to an (N − 3)-parameter family of low-dimensional systems. In the weak-coupling limit, the reduced equations can be analyzed completely. Either all solutions approach the synchronous state or they converge to a continuous family of incoherent oscillations, depending on a certain parameter value. At the transitional value of this parameter, the system becomes completely integrable. Then the phase space is foliated by invariant two-dimensional tori, for any N ⩾ 3. The infinite-N limit of the system is an integro-partial differential equation with rigorously low-dimensional dynamics. It supports solitons in the integrable case, and chaotic waves in the non-integrable case.},
